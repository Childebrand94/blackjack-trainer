    heading: 'High-Low Card Counting',
    instructions: `
    High-Low card counting in Blackjack involves assigning values to cards: +1 for low cards (2-6), -1 for high cards (10-Ace), 
    and 0 for neutral cards (7-9). Players maintain a running count by adding and subtracting these values as cards are dealt. 
    A higher positive count suggests more high cards remain, favoring the player. To refine their advantage, players calculate 
    the true count by dividing the running count by the decks remaining, rounding down to the nearest whole number. A higher 
    true count means a greater advantage. By mastering High-Low card counting and the true count, players can make better betting 
    decisions and improve their odds of winning.
